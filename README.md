# Breast Cancer Hub

Our group created a new version website for Breast Cancer Hub organization, refining their digital presence with a modern design approach. The project aims to showcase effective web design principles while emphasizing the important mission of breast cancer awareness and education.

All images, text content, and organizational information are sourced from the original Breast Cancer Hub organization website (breastcancerhub.org).
