                <p>BCH is an extraordinary non profit organization led by an extraordinary individual- Dr Lopa Das Roy. 
                    The organization was started by Lopa after a lot of personal sacrifice- in terms of her own career, family and 
                    personal growth . She has a single mission - to educate on early detection and prevention of breast cancer and hopefully eradicate cancer from this world with her research work.
                    I feel immensely proud and blessed to be associated with Lopa. BCH transcends all borders and treats every person with equality when it comes to providing support and education to anyone going through their cancer journey. 
                    I have been able to connect my close relatives and friends battling cancer and I have to ask them to stop thanking me for getting them into the network of BCH! 
                    The best part is the support and informed decisions is all free and just a text away!
                    I wish BCH the very best and may this organization continue to shine and lead the way in eradicating cancer.</p>

                <p>I am a doctor from Maldives and I have been a part of another non-profit organization (Cancer society of Maldives), supporting and advocating for cancer patients. 
                    I was introduced to Dr. Lopa through a friend and she introduced me to Breast Cancer Hub. 
                    Dr.Lopa responds to all my queries quickly and genuinely no matter how busy she is and she explains everything with so much passion and interest. 
                    She is always ready to walk that extra mile to help any patient in every possible way. 
                    I am always in complete awe of her ways of approach to any issue. 
                    I am totally inspired by the way the whole BCH community works together to remove the cancer related stigmas. 
                    Moreover, the support they provide to patients are immeasurable and priceless. 
                    I look forward to learn a lot from BCH community and specially from Dr.Lopa. I hope to provide a lot of information and guidance to patients undergoing cancer treatment in my community.</p>
